# FastAPI Template

A robust, production-ready FastAPI template designed to help you build scalable APIs using asynchronous endpoints, modular architecture, Docker, Celery for background tasks, and integrated monitoring with Flower and Nginx reverse-proxy.

> **Note:** This project uses a simplified Repository Pattern to abstract data access. Unlike the full Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach—which typically involves complex aggregate roots and domain entities—the repository implementation here serves as a straightforward abstraction layer to decouple business logic from persistence concerns without the additional overhead of DDD.
>
> This template uses a modular structure with core components and domain-specific folders (e.g., `user` and `admin`). The `core` folder contains common infrastructure (database connections, settings, middleware, models, and schemas) while domain modules provide placeholders for business logic and API endpoints.

## Requirements
- Docker & Docker Compose
---

## Containers
- **Postgres:**
  Hosts the PostgreSQL database with PostGIS capabilities. Built using `Dockerfile-postgis`, it uses environment variables for credentials and persists data in a dedicated volume.

- **App:**
  Runs the main FastAPI application. It starts the server (using Uvicorn, or optionally Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers).

- **Celery_worker:**
  Executes background tasks using Celery.

- **Celery_beat:**
  Acts as the scheduler for periodic tasks.

- **Flower:**
  Provides real-time monitoring for Celery tasks. Based on the official Flower image, it’s built to include your project code.

- **Nginx:**
  Serves as a reverse proxy that routes external HTTP requests to the FastAPI application.

- **Redis:**
  Runs the Redis server for caching and as a Celery result backend. It is secured with a password and persists data in a Docker volume.

- **RabbitMQ:**
  Functions as the message broker for Celery tasks. It uses the official RabbitMQ image with the management plugin enabled, exposing both AMQP (for messaging) and management (for UI) ports.

## Deployment & Setup

This project is entirely containerized and must be deployed using Docker Compose. A Makefile is provided to simplify common tasks such as building, running, stopping, and managing migrations. Follow the instructions below to get started.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker:** [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose:** [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal.
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/darkweid/fastapi-template.git
   cd fastapi-template
   ```

3. Copy the example environment file to create your own:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Open the `.env` file in your favorite editor and configure the required environment variables (e.g., database credentials, RabbitMQ settings, etc.).

### Running the Project

The project uses Docker Compose to orchestrate all services, including the FastAPI app, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Celery Worker, Celery Beat, Flower, and Nginx. Use the provided Makefile to simplify the workflow.

#### Building & Starting the Containers

By following these instructions and using the provided Makefile, you can easily deploy and manage the entire project stack with a few simple commands. Happy coding!

To build the Docker images (if needed) and run all containers in detached mode, use:

```bash
make run
```

This command will:
- Build the images as necessary.
- Start all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

#### Viewing Logs

To view logs for all services:

```bash
make logs
```

To view logs for a specific service, such as the FastAPI app:

```bash
make logs-app
```

Other services (Celery Worker, Celery Beat, PostgreSQL, etc.) can be inspected using the corresponding Makefile targets (e.g., `logs-celery`, `logs-celery-beat`, `logs-postgres`).

#### Stopping and Cleaning Up

- To stop all running containers:

  ```bash
  make down
  ```

- To remove containers, networks, volumes, and local images (and clean up orphaned containers):

  ```bash
  make clean
  ```

- To restart containers:

  ```bash
  make restart
  ```

#### Additional Commands

- **Open a Shell in the App Container:**

  ```bash
  make shell
  ```

- **Database Migrations:**

  - Create a new migration (replace `Your migration message` with an appropriate message):

    ```bash
    make migration message="Your migration message"
    ```

  - Apply all migrations:

    ```bash
    make migrate
    ```

---

### Accessing the Application

- **FastAPI Application:**
  The API is exposed via Nginx on port **80** (You can easily change port in `nginx.conf` and `docker-compose.yml` files). Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost](http://localhost).

- **API Documentation:**
  Once the app is running, access Swagger UI at [http://localhost/docs](http://localhost/docs) or ReDoc at [http://localhost/redoc](http://localhost/redoc).

- **Flower Monitoring:**
  Monitor your Celery tasks at [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555).

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are properly installed.
- Verify that your `.env` file is correctly configured.
- Use `make logs` or specific log commands (e.g., `make logs-app`) to check for error messages.
- If you encounter issues with database migrations, make sure the PostgreSQL container is running and accessible.
